    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>Images can be inserted in an HTML document by using &lt;img&gt tag.
This does not create a copy of image. Instead, it only creates a reference to
original image placed somewhere in the computer's storage.
The &lt;img&gt; tag is an empty tag which means that it does not require a
closing &lt;/img&gt tag. It contains ve attributes out of which two are required
and three are optional.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>&lt;img src="bridge.jpg" alt="Bridge" width="600"&gt;</p>
