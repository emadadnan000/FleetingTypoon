    <h1>HTML LIST</h1>
        <p>Lists are very useful in displaying point by point information such
            as to-do list, list of ingredients for a recipe, list of categories, etc. HTML
            provides three different types of list elements namely Unordered Lists,
            Ordered Lists and Description Lists. The web browsers automatically add
            indents, spaces and markers to HTML lists.</p>
    <h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
        <p>An ordered list also displays a list of related items. It is used where
            the order of the list is important e.g. names of students in order of their
            exam ranks. It is dened by &lt;ol&gt;; tag and each of its list item is dened by
            &lt;li&gt;. The web browser will display these list items with numbers starting
            from 1 instead of bullet points.</p>
    <h2>Unordered Lists</h2>
        <p>An unordered list is used to display a list of related items. It is defined
            by &lt;ul&gt; tag and each of its list item is defined by &lt;li&gt;. The web
            browser will display these list items with bullet points.</p>
    <h2>Description Lists</h2>
        <p>A description list is used to display a list of related items. It is defined
            by &lt;dl&gt; tag and each of its list item is defined by &lt;dt&gt; and &lt;dd&gt;.
            The web browser will display these list items with bullet points.</p>
