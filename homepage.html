    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to
        create web pages that are displayed by web browsers mainly on internet.
        <h2> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h2>
        It is standard markup language for text documents. It allows the
        user to create structured content by adding headings, paragraphs, links,
        blockquotes and other media. It takes advantage of simple code
        structures called tags and attributes to achieve formatting, graphic and
        navigation effects on web pages.</p>
    <h3>Steps to create a HTML page</h3>
    <p>Creating a simple web page using HTML is very easy. It requires a
        text editor, a file with .html extension and a web browser to view that page.</p>
        <h4>Step 1: Text Editor</h4>
        <p>Start by simply creating a new blank le in a text editor of your
        choice. A simple text editor like notepad can be used to start coding HTML
        for a web page.</p>
        <h4>Step 2: HTML File</h4>
        <p>Once you have created a text file, you can open it in a text editor and
        start coding. The first line of the file should be <!DOCTYPE html>.</p>
        <h4>Step 3: Save HTML Page</h4>
        <p>Go to File menu and click on Save. Make sure to provide .htm or
        .html extension for the le being saved. This will save the document as a
        web page instead of a plain text file.</p>
        <h4>Step 4: View HTML page</h4>
        <p>Once you have saved a HTML file, you can open it in a web browser to view it. You can use any web browser to view a HTML file.</p>
